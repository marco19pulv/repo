=== General Diagnostics ===
dmesg                      # Show kernel messages
dmesg | grep error         # Filter errors in kernel logs
top                        # Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, etc.)
htop                       # Interactive version of top
uptime                     # Show system uptime and load average
vmstat 1                   # Analyze system performance (CPU, memory, I/O)

=== Processes ===
ps aux                     # List all processes
ps aux | grep <process>    # Search for a specific process
strace -p <PID>            # Trace system calls of a process
lsof -p <PID>              # Show open files by a process

=== Networking ===
ping <host>                # Test connection to a host
ss -tuln                   # Show open ports and active connections
tcpdump -i <interface>     # Capture network packets on an interface

=== Memory ===
free -h                    # Show memory usage in a human-readable format
cat /proc/meminfo          # Detailed memory information
pmap <PID>                 # Memory mapping of a process

=== Disks and File System ===
df -h                      # Show available disk space
du -sh <directory>         # Show space used by a directory
iostat 1                   # Disk I/O statistics
fsck <device>              # Check and repair file system

=== Logs and Messages ===
journalctl -xe             # View detailed system logs (systemd)
tail -f /var/log/syslog    # Show real-time logs
less /var/log/syslog       # Examine logs with scrolling

=== Advanced Debugging ===
gdb <program> <core_dump>  # Debugger for C/C++ programs
perf top                   # System performance profiling
valgrind <program>         # Memory debugging (e.g., memory leaks)
